Sentiment Analysis with BERT
Overview
This project leverages the power of the BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset. By processing text data, tokenizing it using BERT's tokenizer, and fine-tuning the model on labeled sentiment data, the project classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative. The analysis demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy, achieving a test accuracy of 89%.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Efficiently loads and cleans the IMDb dataset, preparing reviews for analysis through tokenization.
Model Training: Fine-tunes the BERT model for sentiment classification using Hugging Face’s Trainer API.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance, achieving ~89% test accuracy.
Interactive Notebook: Includes a Jupyter Notebook, IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis_with_BERT.ipynb, that combines all steps for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation in an interactive format.
Memory Optimization: Incorporates strategies to handle large datasets effectively without overwhelming memory resources.
Requirements
Python Version: 3.7+
Libraries:
transformers
pandas
scikit-learn
torch
tensorflow
IMDb Dataset: Ensure the dataset is downloaded and structured appropriately (e.g., aclImdb/train and aclImdb/test).

Usage
Option 1: Use the Jupyter Notebook
Open notebooks/IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis_with_BERT.ipynb to run the project interactively.
This notebook covers all steps, from loading the data to evaluating the model.
Option 2: Use the Command Line Scripts
Prepare the Data:

Ensure the IMDb dataset is stored in the data/ directory in the expected format.
Run Preprocessing:

Execute the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and tokenize the dataset.
bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the Model:

Fine-tune the BERT model by running the model_training.py script.
bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
Evaluate Performance:

Test the model and view its accuracy using the evaluation.py script.
bash
Copy code
python src/evaluation.py

Model Performance
Training Accuracy: ~93%
Test Accuracy: ~89%
This marks a significant improvement from the initial accuracy of 69%.
